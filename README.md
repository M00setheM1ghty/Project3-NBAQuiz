Welcome Thomas Baumann,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

-----
Happy coding!

## Project goals and target audience.  
### Achieved:
- Build a quiz game that asks different questions depending on your decisions on game length and difficulty.
- Tracks score in the game played.
- Be easy to understand and navigate.
- Make it colorful so it is easy to read give it some contrast. 

### Future projects: 
- Add more questions and different topics to make the game different every time.
- Take names from players and keep the scores in the database. (e.g all time questions answered, all time correct answers etc.)    

## Audience:
- This game is for everyone, since the given topic can be studied in the game. 
- I suppose it is more fun for sports or specifically for people interested in basketball.
